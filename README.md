# üìñBook Search Engine

This project is a refactoring of a fully functioning Google Books API search engine, which was initially built with a RESTful API. The refactoring process involves transforming it into a GraphQL API using Apollo Server.

## Description

The Book Search Engine project is a robust and interactive web application that allows users to search for their favorite books using the Google Books API. Initially built with a RESTful API, the application has been refactored to use a GraphQL API with Apollo Server. User authentication is handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), providing secure access and maintaining user sessions. This transformation enhances the efficiency of data retrieval by allowing clients to specify exactly what data they need, reducing the amount of data transferred over the network and improving performance. The application continues to provide a user-friendly interface and a seamless book searching experience, now with the added benefits of GraphQL technology and secure JWT authentication.
